# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## Description
This Python script provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation. It swaps pixel values and applies a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. The tool is useful for learning about image processing and basic encryption techniques.

## Features
- Encrypt an image by rearranging pixel values.
- Decrypt an encrypted image to restore the original image.
- Simple to use with customizable encryption keys.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `Pillow` library
- `numpy` library

## Installation
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
